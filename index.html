    <h2>Proposal</h2>

    The publication of <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~plclub/poplmark/">POPLMark</a>
    spearheaded the era of publishing formal proofs alongside with new research.
    This fostered an era of high-quality and high-assurance proofs at top venues for programming language
    research. In this project we simultaneously acknowledge the impact of the original POPLMark challenge,
    and propose a new benchmark intended to stimulate the research and dissemination of techniques that address
    the particular challenges of process calculi and behavioural type systems. We propose three challenge problems
    concerning to process calculi and name passing, linearity in behavioural type systems,
    and coinductive reasoning for process algebras.

    <h2>A draft of the proposal</h2>

    This idea is still in the planning stages.We have a draft document
    that is <em>slowly</em> evolving into the actual challenge. The
    current draft can be
    found <a href="https://concurrentbenchmark.github.io/concurrentbenchmark/POPLMarkGoesConcurrent.pdf">
    here.</a> Be warned that we really mean it when we call it is a draft.
